## projectM-on-shield

*A collection of projectM presets that I find work well enough in the Kodi addon for Android devices, and more specifically the Nvidia SHIELD TV.*

---

### Directions for use
- Copy the contents of this repository somewhere local on your Android device. *I personally keep a "Kodi" sub-directory in the /sdcard directory for a variety of user controlled type files relevant to kodi that I do not want overwritten or even touched by anything within Kodi.*
- In the visualization options of the ProjectM addon, set the 'Preset Pack' option to 'User Defined Preset Folder' and navigate to where you copied the repo contents to for the second option.
- DONE
